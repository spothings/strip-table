## About Project
The project aims to develop a sophisticated controller capable of efficiently managing the control of lamps using an integrated system comprising an LDF sensor, PIR sensor, real-time clock, and a Telegram bot. By combining these elements, the controller will be able to autonomously detect ambient light levels through the LDF sensor, trigger the lamps based on movement sensed by the PIR sensor, schedule lighting operations using the real-time clock, and provide remote control and monitoring capabilities through the Telegram bot. This comprehensive solution will enhance energy efficiency, convenience, and security by seamlessly adapting to changing lighting requirements and allowing users to effortlessly interact with the system via the Telegram platform.
